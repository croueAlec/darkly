# Darkly

A Web Security project based on a virtual machine provided on the project page.
We have to find, exploit and explain **14** security breaches in the website. They range from true security issues such as weak passwords (exploited with bruteforce), SQL injections to CTFs (exploited using crawlers).


## A few useful tools

https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/ ~ **OWASP** a project referencing most of the breaches we will exploit here.  

https://www.kali.org/tools/dirb/ ~ **Dirb** a web scanner.  

https://portswigger.net/burp ~ **Burp** an all around useful audit tool containing a bruteforcer, a crawler and others.  

https://md5decrypt.net/ and https://www.dcode.fr/fonction-hash ~ **Hash decryption** both links are useful for hash decrytion, the second one is weaker but tests a few at the same time.
